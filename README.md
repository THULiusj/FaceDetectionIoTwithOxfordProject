# FaceDetectionIoTwithOxfordProject
Face detection IoT demo is a demo combining Windows 10 IoT Core @RPi2 and Azure and Project Oxford, to implement a scenario that people's face can be captured in the real time video ingested from the camera on RPi2 and be identified through analysis in Azure and Project Oxford.
